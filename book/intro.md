# Welcome to AI 101

_This book is for anyone who is interested in learning AI._

With the rapid progress in the field of AI, it can feel intimidating to know where to begin. I was often confused by buzzwords that overshadowed the core ideas and theories behind the technology. However, once we understand what these core concepts are—and why they were designed the way they are—AI no longer feels like magic.

My hope is that this book is both readable and helpful for anyone who wants to build a clear, foundational understanding of AI.
